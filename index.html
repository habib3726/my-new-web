            <h3 id="tea-h">Tea and Health</h3>
            <p>Animal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies
                have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea
                consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease,
                stroke, and type 2 diabetes. [2] However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach
                cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (more than 131-140° F [55-60° C]). [2,3] Randomized controlled
                trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime,
                there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot
                tea. So pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup!</p>
